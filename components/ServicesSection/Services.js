            Choosing a gas/electricity supplier for your business can be taxing
            and time consuming. If running a small, medium or corporate sized
            business, you can possibly slash down your gas and power expenditure
            by switching tariffs or providers. But unlike domestic energy,
            tariffs are customized and can have huge variations. So, the idea
            behind finding the most suitable business electricity is shopping
            around.
